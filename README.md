COVID 19 ANALYSIS REPORT
Here I have done Covid 19 Analysis Report.
In report view we can see the total confirmed cases, death cases, recovered cases, and active cases. 
Then I have used a map to show global distribution of covid19 cases. 
To show active cases i have used clustered bar chart.
Tree map is used to show active cases in WHO region.
Stacked bar chart is used to view sum of recovered and sum of death.
Ribbon chart is used to shoe sum of death by confirmed people.
Area chart is used to show sum of recovered & sum of new cases by active cases.
Stacked column chart is used to show 1 week changes.
A piechart & donut chart is used to show sum of confirmed & recovered by WHO region simultaneously.
At last a slicer is used to view datas according to each who region.
